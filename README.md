# Savistar Ops

Operations platform for **Savistar** (interior design — projects with milestones, site visits,
client conversations) and **Saag** (furniture workshop — orders, employees, vendors). Same owners,
one app, one combined finance book.

Next.js 14 (App Router) · shadcn/ui · Turso (libSQL, local SQLite fallback) · JWT auth ·
Cloudflare R2 for files · OpenRouter for bank-statement extraction.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
```

First run auto-creates the schema and seeds three logins — change these passwords in Settings
right after first login:

| Username | Password | Role |
|----------|----------|------|
| `hari` | `hari123` | Admin (owner) |
| `sachi` | `sachi123` | Admin (owner) |
| `dristi` | `dristi123` | Staff (office) — no Finance access |

Copy `env.example` to `.env.local` and fill what you need — everything degrades gracefully:
without `R2_*` file uploads are disabled, without `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` bank extraction is disabled,
without `TURSO_URL` data goes to `./savistar-ops-local.db`.

## Tabs

- **Home** — month calendar (tasks, project milestones, site visits, order due dates) + today/overdue tasks
- **Clients** — shared client list for both companies; conversation log per client (optionally pinned to a project)
- **Projects** (Savistar) — milestones checklist, site visits, linked Saag orders & vendor POs, conversations
- **Orders** (Saag) — workshop orders; work history shows who worked on what part, when
- **People** — employees (salary or daily wage), daily worksheet (attendance in/out + per-order work log with
  part description and rating), expenses/advances, payroll (computed: days × rate − advances)
- **Vendors** — per-route freight rate card with automatic overcharge flags; POs with partial
  delivery / return tracking (outstanding = ordered − delivered + returned)
- **Finance** — Cash: manual credit/debit ledger with file attachments. Bank: upload statement PDF →
  AI extracts transactions → review with per-line notes and receipt attachments. Hidden entirely
  from staff — no nav link, direct URL redirects away, and every finance API route rejects them
- **Settings** — user management (admin/manager only). Roles: admin, manager, user (staff);
  deleting records requires admin/manager

## Roles

- **admin / manager** — full access to every tab including Finance; can assign tasks to anyone,
  see everyone's tasks on Home, manage users in Settings
- **user (staff)** — everything except Finance and Settings; Home only shows tasks assigned to
  them, and they can only create tasks for themselves (not assign to others)

## Deploy (Render)

Plain Node web service — no Docker:

- Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
- Start command: `npm start`
- Env vars: everything from `env.example` (set `TURSO_URL`/`TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`, a real
  `SESSION_SECRET`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, the `R2_*` set, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`)

Create a **new** Turso DB and a **new** R2 bucket for this company — do not reuse ls_crm's.
